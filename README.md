# GROWW – Gene Therapy Solution for Hair Regrowth

## Overview
**GROWW** is a biotechnology-based project focused on developing an innovative, painless, and cost-effective gene therapy treatment for alopecia (baldness).  
The project aims to activate and regulate the **Wnt/β-catenin** and **Sonic Hedgehog (SHH)** signalling pathways to extend the hair growth (anagen) phase and promote natural, permanent hair regrowth.

---

## Motivation
The global incidence of alopecia has risen by nearly 50% in the past decade, affecting millions worldwide.  
Current FDA-approved treatments such as **finasteride**, **minoxidil**, and **low-level laser therapy (LLLLT)** show inconsistent results and often require lifelong use.  
**GROWW** addresses this gap by targeting the genetic and molecular causes of baldness through **gene-level intervention** rather than surface-level treatment.

## Research Foundation
Alopecia results from dysregulation of signalling pathways involved in hair follicle morphogenesis.  
The project builds upon the following biological mechanisms:

- **Wnt/β-catenin pathway:** Promotes follicle regeneration and hair growth.  
- **DKK1 inhibition:** Prevents suppression of the Wnt pathway, enhancing follicular activity.  
- **SHH (Sonic Hedgehog) pathway:** Initiates early anagen phase and supports continuous follicle cycling.

Key supporting research:
- *Papukashvili et al. (2021):* miRNAs targeting DKK1 for hair regeneration.  
- *Kwack et al. (2012):* Anti-DKK1 antibody extended the anagen phase in vivo.  
- *Ohyama et al. (2003):* SHH gene delivery promoted early anagen initiation in mice.

## Objectives
1. Continue **in vivo** studies to validate efficacy and safety.  
2. Initiate **clinical trials** within one year to test human application feasibility.  
3. Partner with **government agencies** for ethical oversight and regulatory compliance.  
4. Build a **scalable treatment model** for commercialisation in biotechnology markets.

## Business Proposition
**GROWW** envisions disrupting the global baldness treatment market by offering:
- A **painless**, **permanent**, and **low-cost** alternative to transplants.  
- A **gene therapy-based solution** with higher efficacy and minimal side effects.  
- A clear **commercial pathway** targeting individuals aged 20–40 and hospitals as secondary clients.
